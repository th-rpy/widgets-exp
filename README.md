- Completed the evaluation of CDK Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and performed thorough testing in the kmslive2 environment. Made necessary reconfigurations and recalculations to ensure accurate results. Sent an email to the FPI teams, requesting their review and validation of the KPIs. Preparing to implement them in the production environment as the next step.

- Collaborated with AL (Alerts Team) to review the logic behind the alert rules. Identified a comprehensive list of supported alerts that can be utilized for testing purposes. Suggested executing the alerts within a single kilnbatch to validate the calculation accuracy and functionality.
