I have successfully completed the necessary adjustments to the data import Python code, considering the modifications made to the SQL function. As a result, we now have three distinct importation statuses: Success, Failed, and File already imported. 

Moreover, I resolved some issues pertaining to the import data logger and HF data types, thoroughly testing them to ensure their functionality. 

To further enhance the code, I conducted a thorough cleanup of the data import section, eliminating any redundant or unnecessary elements. Following this cleanup, I pushed the updated code to the repository.
