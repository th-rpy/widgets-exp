- Completed the implementation of daily KPIs for CDK in the production side, collaborating with AL. Introduced enhanced security measures in calculations to prevent runtime warnings. Optimized the CDK code through refactoring, including function renaming, signature changes, and leveraging efficient numpy operations to improve code performance. Successfully pushed the updated code to the dev_cdk branch.

- Fine-tuned alert KPIs by incorporating time-based calculations: 6030, 6040, and 6050. Validated the adjustments by generating a CSV file and cross-checking the resulting alerts in KMSWEB. Confirmed that the generated alerts align with the expected outcomes, indicating the accuracy of the changes.
