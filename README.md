- Implemented the requested feature by Marc, which involved adding a new signal called "kxta003" that calculates a moving average. Also included a function to generate calculated signals based on time mode. After thorough testing, I pushed the code to the repository.

- Asked AD to review the code and merge it into kmsweb if it performs as expected.

- Fine-tuned the calculations for the alert functions, aligning them with the time-based calculations. Made significant improvements to the code for alerts 1050, 6030, and 6040. Conducted tests to verify the effectiveness of the updated adjustments.

- Created an Excel file to compile a comprehensive list of all CDK alerts, along with their deployment status and any necessary adjustments. Currently, most alerts are in the testing phase, while some are on hold until their logic rules or parameters are finalized.

- Wrote certain alerts into the "Test bensh" database, allowing the FPI teams to assess the accuracy of these alerts.
