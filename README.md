- Completed the implementation of AL's suggestions for styling the digital graph.
- Conducted a review of the digital graph with AL and AD, addressing areas for improvement in styling and adding a button to hide the digital graph.
- Implemented the suggested changes, resulting in significant improvements to the graph's functionality as anticipated.
- Completed the code cleanup and pushed the changes to the kmsweb CDK, allowing AD to review and merge them into the test branch.
- Commenced the review of the issues mentioned by Samuel, particularly focusing on batch-related concerns.
- During a preliminary examination, we identified an anomaly with batch 6149-2. It appeared to be associated with two different pkg_nb values (213 and 248). This abnormality prompted a decision by AL to investigate further and, if confirmed, divide the batch into two separate batches labeled as 6149-2a (corresponding to pkg_nb 213) and 6149-2b (corresponding to pkg_nb 249).
- Added two functions in the Tools folder to facilitate visualizing the position signal based on pkg_nb and batch-bundle respectively.
