"""
Improvements Made:
1. Replaced the second and third "if" statements with "elif" statements for clarity.
2. Utilized the "else" statement for the final condition as it covers the fully out scenario.
3. Retained the original variable names for clarity.
4. Removed the import statement for numpy as it's already imported in the previous code block.
5. Maintained the function signature and type hints.
