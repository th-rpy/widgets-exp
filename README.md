- Reviewed the latest changes in CDK functions and made improvements. Added CDK parameters to the function that defines the package number for a CDK bundle. Updated the code to be more generic, enabling easier adaptation in other projects.
- Tested the new changes thoroughly and implemented them in the test functions. Pushed the updated code to the repository.
- Started merging the develop branch into the dev CDK branch. Ensured file-by-file verification to ensure that the dev CDK code matches the one in the develop branch.
- For the kmsweb CDK, added CDK parameters to the function and made necessary adaptations to the existing code. Merged the kmsweb branch into the kmsweb CDK branch and pushed the changes.
- Completed the Canfor project by writing a comprehensive script that retrieves start date, end date, and Mc values from a text file. Created multiple tests to validate all the functions used, and all tests passed successfully.
- Organized the code and pushed it to the Kmsweb_wellisons repository.
- Discussed the next steps with +AL: planning to write and configure Mc signals in the local database.
