- Enhanced alert signal calculations by incorporating additional signals for valve chauffage-based alerts and included a set point temperature.

- Developed code for the following alerts: 1150, 3111, 3121, 3131, 3141, 3151, 3161, 3171, and made improvements to the generic valve-based alert calculations.

- Conducted testing by generating a CSV file. The results require review from AL (Assurance Lead).

- Additionally, integrated all KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) from CDK into the test bench, including daily KPIs. Samuel and the fpi teams can verify and evaluate the values.
