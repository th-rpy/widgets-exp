- Continued writing the code for alerts: implemented alerts 6030, 6040, and 6050. Conducted thorough testing by generating a CSV file to verify their functionality.

- Made progress on integrating alerts CDK (Continuous Delivery Kit) with the database. Addressed several issues and successfully executed an analysis on a single kiln batch. The alerts were successfully stored in the database, but there is currently no data displaying in Kmsweb.

- Additionally, made efforts to investigate the reason behind the absence of alerts in the Kmsweb test environment, and actively sought to understand the underlying cause for this issue.
