...............................

- Complete the configuration of all alerts for CDK (French version): add alerts for all valves.
- Add the English text for conventional lion alerts: the translation is incorrect for some alerts. I will contact Kildare regarding this matter.
- Finish adding parameters in the titles and descriptions of the alerts.
- Configure the two alerts "avg_push_rate" and "avg_stp_temp".
- Write the code for these two KPIs and perform testing.
- Configure the KPI "text_batch_nb" for CDK.
